Project Objective
###################

The goal of this project is to strengthen my PHP and HTML skills using the CodeIgniter framework.
This project communicates with a MySQL database and is (currently) running on an Apache 2.4 local
server.

Some custom CSS is used, though it is not the focus of this project. Styling for certain items
(like the article page) use templates from W3Schools. In conjunction with this, the navbar used
was created using Bootstrap.
